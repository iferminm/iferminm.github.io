I also do freelance consulting onsite or online, depending on where you are located,
I might not might not get involved in writing code for you depending on the project itself,
but I'm always willing to review what your team has done.

The fields I cover are:

* DevOps, automation and CICD
* Tech leadership
* Software, systems and cloud architecture and design
* Service oriented architecture and migration to microservices
* Performance optimization
* Requirements analysis

I also enjoy advising non-technical startup founders scoping and building their MVP..
