    So, what are you working on... now?

Well, I'm mostly focusing on few stuff right now in no particular order.

* Blogging at least twice a month
* Reading about *Microservices*, *Software Architecture*, *Software Engineering* and *CI/CD*
* Working on my personal projects (links coming soon)
* Speaking (only online during COVID-19 crisis) at meetups and conferences
* Being part of the backend Tigers team @ [Careem](http://careem.com)
