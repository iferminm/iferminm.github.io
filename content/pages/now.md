    So, what are you working on... now?

Well, I'm mostly focusing on few stuff right now in no particular order.

* Being the best husband I can be
* Being the best dad I can be
* Blogging at least twice a month
* Reading about *Microservices*, *Software Architecture*, *Software Engineering* and *CI/CD*
* Working on launching a personal project
* Being part of the backend Tigers team @ [Careem](http://careem.com)
* Online mentoring @ [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net)
