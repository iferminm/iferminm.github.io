    So, what are you working on... now?

Well, I'm mostly focusing on few stuff right now.

* Being the best husband I can be
* Being the best dad I can be
* Blogging at least twice a month
* Working on launching a personal project
* Being part of the backend superstars @ [dubizzle](http://dubizzle.com)
* Online mentoring @ [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net)
