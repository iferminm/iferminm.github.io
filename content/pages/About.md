Hello there!

I'm Israel, and I'm not as bad as they say in the news. I'm a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a friend and also a software engineer who likes to
spend most of his time with his family, reading or experimenting with programming tools and techniques or technology in general. I'm originally from
Venezuela and in 2014 I married Giselle (my wife, obviously) and moved to Dubai with her and in 2016 we got a wonderful gift, our daughter Antonietta.

I'm interested in music (writing and composing as well as listening to good music), and computer science specially programming languages (how to
implement them and how to use them effectively) and machine learning as well as software engineering, specially software architecture, tuning,
performance and testing / verification. You can check my now page (coming soon) if you want a more specific overview of what I'm doing right now.
