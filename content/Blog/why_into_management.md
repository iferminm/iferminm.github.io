I've reached a point in my career in which I'm questioning a lot of things about
being a Software Engineer, don't misunderstand me, I love being a Software
Engineer and getting my hands dirty writing code, implementing things, designing
systems and discussing architectural tradeoffs with other Engineers, the mix of
art and science in what we do is amazing, but I'm afraid growth paths as an
Individual Contributor (IC) are more complicated and less documented than the ones
for People Managers (PM).

As an C, it seems like your growth will depend on the
impression others have about your individual work, those others are usually
PMs, as a PM, your growth depends on the performance
of your team and the ability to achieve those quarterly goals.

Here are a few things I think are a bit odd when it comes to growing as an IC.

# Product > Engineering
It might seem strange becaise in some companies the organization in charge of
building and maintaining the user-facing systems it's called *Product Engineering*,
but quite often *Engineering* is a sidecar of *Product*
