As Software Engineers, we are not measured by how much we know about computer
science, data structures and algorithms, at least not after we pass the interview.
At the job the story is completely different, we can be the best programmers in
the company, we can know our way around the languages we work on and write code
with the eyes closed but, none of that matters if we produce no value. Our value
comes in many forms, code and working, scalable and robust software is one of those
ways, but we can't forget we are part of an engineering team and also keep in mind
that [Software Engineering is more than writing code](software_engineering.md)
