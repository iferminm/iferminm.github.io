OpenSource software has been out there for quite a long time, the idea of people
around the world volunteering part of their time to work on free software is
very exciting, but also maintaining those projects is very hard. Keeping everyone
on the same page so that there's no duplicated work, agreeing on the roadmap and
what's going or needs to be done, prioritizing bugs, reviewing code, merging and
then, everyone updating their local repos or forks. OpenSource software development
is a huge human distributed system which, most of the time, uses async communication
due to the inability to get every single developer working on the software in a room
or, at least, a virtual call for obvious reasons: timezones, everyone works on different
schedules so everyone is free at different times and most of the people also work full time
for software companies, most of the time on other projects.

OpenSource projects and free software development has tons of limitations in the way they
can coordinate and communicate with the entire team, and yet OpenSource projects
has higher standards and a higher bar than most close-source projects or corporate-internal
software built inhouse. This is why, whenever I need to do something at work, whenvever I need
to research for best practices in how to manage a project, how to manage or coordinate a team,
how to do anything with tech, I reffer to how the team behind my favorite OpenSource project
at the moment is doing things and borrow as many ideas as possible and see how to adapt them
to what I'm working on or the team I'm working with. OpenSource has very complex people
problems, team members are scatered all around the globe, if their strategies, policies and
practices help them solve their problems, they should also work at a smaller scale in private
companies building software.

The Cathedral and the Bazaar is an essay written by Eric Raymond, in this essay he examines two
different approaches to Software Development by two different OpenSource projects
