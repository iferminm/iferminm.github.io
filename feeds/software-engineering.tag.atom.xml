tell you what to learn next or which language or technologies are 
worth your attention, things like &lt;em&gt;Top 10 programming languages&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;Learn one of these languages and you'll be done&lt;/em&gt; with some statistics
about language popularity but the truth is, none of those make sense
no one can tell you what to learn and you don't need to study whatever
is popular out there all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, while popular languages are widely used, also, supply is high,
hence, salaries will tend to be lower, on the other hand, if you learn
the not-so-popular ones, salaries would be higher but you'll end up
most likely having a hard time finding a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trends come and go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever is popular today, might be considered terrible in the future as well
as what's not so popular today, might be widely used in future, you just have
to see the growth trends in whatever languages or technologies you're into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few years back, for example, JavaScript was used only for frontend development
and JQuery was the best thing out there for it, now almost no one uses JQuery
directly, everyone is using react, angular or vue and now you can even find
JavaScript on the backend (not that that's a good thing IMO...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, we should not chase the top 10 most popular technologies, we should
try to find a balance, otherwise we won't really fully learn nor master anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My view&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that, the first thing we need to do is, work on what's paying your bills.
Few years back, for example, Python was the one paying my bills and it happened to
be the first language I worked with after graduating, I became passionate about it,
to the point that I organized meetups and conferences back home in Caracas - Venezuela
and after that, I only looked for jobs in Python, it was gaining popularity and growing
a lot, I know, I was lucky, but it also makes a point, I was focused on becoming
better on a single thing which were the technologies I was working with at that point
in time, the full stack was Python, Postgres and OpenERP (now it goes by Odoo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone should start by that, just become better and learn more about
the stack you're currently working with. My last 100% Python job was at my
previous company (dubizzle/OLX), when I joined Careem the stack I worked with
changed to Java, Springboot and MySQL mainly, so I started over, learning a new
framework and a not-so-new language to me. Then, I switched teams and the stack
was Python, Jenkins (groovy) and Terraform, again, learning new things. Then, after
almost 2 years, I again switched teams and the stack was Typescript, Express, Node,
and both MySQL and Postgres and after few months I was changed to a different team again,
the stack also changed and now, this team works on PHP and Go for the most part and
MySQL. Whenever your stack at work changes, focus on learning and mastering that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you master whatever is helping you pay your bills, you can use your spare
time to learn whatever you want, in my opinion you need to know at least one
of those popular languages just to make sure if something unexpected happens 
to your current job, you can find a new one quick. In my case, maybe I've been
just lucky, I know Python, Java and JavaScript and those are three of the most
popular languages out there today. But I also know their popularity won't last forever
and that some less popular languages might pay better salaries because supply is
less and the skills are more rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is free to learn whatever they want, but this is how I think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start by what pays your bills:&lt;/strong&gt; this is important, you need to be efficient at
your work and the only way to achieve it is by learning how to use your tools
effectively. This will help you do more in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One popular language:&lt;/strong&gt; well, at least one, if you like more than one, go for it,
why learning the popular ones?, this will open the door for more job opportunities,
you never know what will happen and it's better to be prepared to hunt (or be hunted)
for a new role on a different company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One high level language:&lt;/strong&gt; the higher level, the best, I'd go for a language with
a dynamic but strong type system, why? to build things quick. Usually high level
dynamic languages have a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks you can leverage
your work on and achieve more writing less code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One lower level language:&lt;/strong&gt; you never know when you'll need either more speed or
write something at system level or even have more control over how the program will
manage memory. Truth is, not all use cases are covered by a High Level object oriented
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not too hard to achieve that, you can mix and match languages in all those buckets, 
for example, in most of the cases what pays your bills will be a popular high level
language, that covers the first three, then you'll only need to learn a lower level
programming language to be all setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you cover that, you can explore other paradigms and incorporate more patterns
and practices from those paradigms and other languages into your every day programming
style, by learning, understanding and practicing is the only way we become better
software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, as I know JavaScript/Typescript, Python and Java because of previous jobs,
maybe not all of them at an expert level but at least a general understanding so that
I can tackle most of the day-to-day tasks using them.
I'm focusing on learning Rust, it's a language which is growing and implements interesting
concepts and I've toyed around with Smalltalk and Haskell to see what's there to learn and 
incorporate new practices into my coding. &lt;/p&gt;

with the rest of the team more often. Of course, we do code reviews and
we have some other ways to get the knowledge spread across the team, we have
a wiki on confluence, we have tech meetings where we talk about how we will
solve the problems at hand, those are good opportunities for very specific
knowledge sharing, which would be in the form of advice or guidance on the
approach to follow to implement something, but it would be nice to have
some other kind of sessions to keep the team motivated, active and seeing
each other while the lockdown lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of several topics I could talk about, all technical ones:
DevOps, Distributed Systems, Functional Programming, very exciting ones
but then I realized, the team is very very good technically, everyone is
a very capable &lt;em&gt;programmer&lt;/em&gt;, and then I stopped. See, I said &lt;em&gt;programmer&lt;/em&gt;,
is that what we are?, nope, definitely not. The job title says &lt;strong&gt;Software
Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, is that all we do? write code?, I don't think so. I started writing
my thoughts and put them together in the form of a talk I'll summarize in this blog
post. Thinking about it, most of us don't realize the complexity around
&lt;strong&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; and we minimize our work to &lt;em&gt;yeah, I write code and
stuff&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I maintain and implement new features&lt;/em&gt; but everything is much more
complex than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Programmer vs Developer vs Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't misunderstand me, there are plenty of roles our there and we call ourselves
in many ways: &lt;em&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Software Developer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Programmer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Computer
Programmer&lt;/em&gt; but words have an impact and everything has a meaning, I believe
we should name things correctly. I'm not asking everyone to think or name things the same
as I do, but I do think we should separate things and roles in a better way and with
different expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programmer is someone who writes code, that's it, a programmer wouldn't care
too much about Software Architecture or Design, neither about the whole lifestyle.
A programmer gets the full spec of what they need to implement, they write the code
and they deliver it, not much thoughts about how it's going to be deployed, where it's
going to run or how it's going to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software developer will care about the software, a bit of design and architecture
but that's it, not much interest in where it's going to be deployed, how it's going to
run or how it's going to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying all programmer or developers are like that, I'm just saying these should be
the concerns of those roles. If you consider yourself a Programmer or a Developer and you go
beyond that, great!, now, the whole point of this article is to share my views and definition
about the &lt;strong&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Software Engineer, just like a Programmer and Developer, they care about Software,
they also write code and make sure it works as expected but also worry about design,
architecture and implementing best practices on every aspect about software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building:&lt;/strong&gt; as a Software Engineer, we worry about building good software, not only
about the software itself, we worry about the building blocks, choosing (or building) the 
correct ones, implementing the right levels of abstraction so that maintainability is
easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating:&lt;/strong&gt; as a Software Engineer, we know we don't have to always build something
new, we can just run existing software and operate it, monitor, manage and make sure
it runs smoothly so that every user can accomplish their goals with it. Also, we know that
the software we build needs to be operated by someone (sometimes ourselves) so we need to build
ways to interface and interact with it from an admin perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a usually forgotten one, we read ridiculous amounts of manuals and
other types of documentation and interpret them in order to use third party software, but we also
need to write docs in order for other to use our software or understand and contribute to our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We know about software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need to know a lot about it, not only to write it, but also to use it effectively, when building
it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to be well done:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about architecture, design and making the right decisions
from the ground up: choosing the right stack, building the right abstractions and applying the best
practices we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to be operable:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about things like CICD, monitoring, logging. Building it
in a way so that it is easy to debug and find issues while running on production as well as building ways
to interact with it to gather information, metrics or reports via command line if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to work:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about testing and verification so that the behavior of the systems
we build is predictable, injective and idempotent. For a set of inputs, the output is something we expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We know around software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We not only know how to build software, we also know many things around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to run somewhere:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about infrastructure and operating systems, but we're not
sysadmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it talks to other software:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about network and communication protocols as well as
distributed systems, but we're not network engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to store data somewhere:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about databases and data modeling, we have to do it
efficiently and we have to know how to tune performance if needed, but we're not sysadmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to function in a certain way:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about testing at several levels and of different kind:
performance, unit testing, integration, UX and UI testing, API tests. But we're not QA engineers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We are part of a team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I mentioned before is very difficult and complex and, to add to that, we need to work with other humans,
we are part of a team which usually has people from diverse backgrounds and specialties, a (sometimes non technical)
Product or Project Manager, an Engineering Manager, some front end engineers, QA specialists and so on, we need to
communicate in different ways and keep everyone aligned on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings:&lt;/strong&gt; we need to attend meetings in order to brief about the technicalities if the work being done
and unblock if someone needs help with something we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; this comes in many forms, technical specs, API documentation, all of this is, at the end of the day,
communication that needs to flow constantly, just that we choose to store it in the form of text to that we don't have
to repeat ourselves every time when someone needs to use the API or go through how something was implemented and the thought
process behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a good one, this is when we get to mentor people and help them get their work into a better shape,
also when we get help to improve ours and learn from others, this is also another form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not taking anything from this post, the only thing I'd like you to think about is that, yes, hard skills are very important
for the Software Engineering role, we need to think about how we write code that performs better, but none of that is useful if we are unable
to work with others. To work with others, communication is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't assume the people you're talking to knows or has the same context you have, always start by sharing the contextual information
needed to understand the problem at hand or the solution you'll present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your audience, it's not like you're performing a stand-up comedy routine but, when you're communicating, you do have an audience,
setting the tone and language is important, it's not the same talking (or writing for) API users than writing (or talking) to someone
whose code you're reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always ask, you never know if the others are assuming some context, the only way to find out is asking. When something is not clear
or you find yourself assuming something, that's when you need to ask. You can ask a question because you don't know something or a
clarifying question, which might seem redundant, just to make sure everyone is on the same page and getting the same understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you realize you don't know it all and you don't have to know everything, you also realize the rest of the people
also don't know everything, and they also don't have to know it all, everyone comes from different backgrounds and knows some things
they've been exposed to or studied and ignore some others. Only by talking to each other, communicating and sharing knowledge we all
become stronger engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

which doesn't mean those are the only ones, it only means that those are the ones I've seen work for me
and the ones I've tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I would like to focus on &lt;strong&gt;Choreography over …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="http://iffm.me/my-take-on-microservices.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt;, we went through the best practices I've seen,
which doesn't mean those are the only ones, it only means that those are the ones I've seen work for me
and the ones I've tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I would like to focus on &lt;strong&gt;Choreography over Orchestration&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rely on data, not services&lt;/strong&gt; because
I feel I didn't develop enough on these ones and those are really important these are also the two &lt;em&gt;principles&lt;/em&gt; 
that will help you &lt;em&gt;avoid sync calls&lt;/em&gt;, which is usually a good practice for inter-service communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal &lt;em&gt;REST&lt;/em&gt; services, why not?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love &lt;em&gt;REST&lt;/em&gt;, I like building &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;s and I enjoy using a well designed one for sure, but for internal
communication I prefer to avoid it unless the communication &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; to be synchronous, there are some cases where you can't
help it and it's not always because of a bad design, sometimes the use case itself enforces that restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself using network calls most of the time, something will most likely go wrong. Network is not 100% reliable
and, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; remember, &lt;em&gt;if something can fail, it will fail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increases overall response time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following figure: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Services map" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k261ik209fporvr/service_down.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response times are not taking into account the wait time while the downstream services
respond. This means, &lt;em&gt;service 1&lt;/em&gt; queries &lt;em&gt;service 2&lt;/em&gt;, it does &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; and takes 10ms to respond. Also, &lt;em&gt;Service 1&lt;/em&gt; queries
&lt;em&gt;Service 3&lt;/em&gt; which queries &lt;em&gt;Service 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Service 5&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Service 4&lt;/em&gt; does &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; and takes 300ms to respond and &lt;em&gt;Service 5&lt;/em&gt;
queries &lt;em&gt;Service 6&lt;/em&gt; which takes 1000ms to respond, then &lt;em&gt;Service 5&lt;/em&gt; does &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; and takes another 1200ms to come back to
&lt;em&gt;Service 3&lt;/em&gt;, which has been waiting 2200ms to get all the data it needs to do &lt;em&gt;some stuff&lt;/em&gt; which takes 300ms. By this time,
&lt;em&gt;Service 1&lt;/em&gt; has been waiting 2500ms for all the data it needs to do a 120ms &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; and return back to the upstream caller,
which could be another service waiting or the end user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the above flow paralelizes all the needed downstream calls per service, so in this case, the total response time will be
constrained by the slowest call chain. If you were using a stack where doing multiprocessing or async programming is not an easy
option, you'll have to add up the response time for all of the downstream calls because in reality the service in question
is being blocked while waiting for the network call to finish and, only then, making the second call and blocking until it comes back
and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways you can keep the same setup, you can add several levels of cache in between services, you can add a timeout
to the network calls but everything comes at a cost. If you're keeping a synchronous approach to answer certain questions it's because
you need your data as fresh as possible, so, the more cache you add the more stale your data could be. You could also add a timeout to
your calls but, if one of them times out, you'll fail in responding to the upstream caller and it will look like the system is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if someone is down?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let imagine &lt;em&gt;Service 6&lt;/em&gt; is down because we had a buggy release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, &lt;em&gt;Service 1&lt;/em&gt; will have to wait 1500ms before returning an error upstream, you can mitigate this
with a &lt;a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html"&gt;circuit breaker&lt;/a&gt; approach or returning a 
cached response for the query you're trying to answer but,
again, unless you really need this to be synchronous, you'd be adding more complexity to an already complex
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, what if it isn't a &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; operation, what if we're actually &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; downstream and the last write fails
because of &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt;. You'll be half way a transaction and you'll have to deal with it somehow, either queuing that
last write and hoping &lt;em&gt;Service 6&lt;/em&gt; comes back soon or rolling back the whole transaction which would mean deleting from
the other services and returning an error, there are ways to solve this, but usually it doesn't need to be this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When should I go synchronous?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it will depend on the use case you're implementing and how critical it is to
return the exact data at the moment the request was done, usually there's some tolerance to
return slightly stale data, but things like &lt;em&gt;credit accounting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;warehouse availability&lt;/em&gt; or
anything that was to do with resources being consumed in real time are good candidates for
sync calls and all the complexity they involve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choreography vs Orchestration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good analogy in the &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; world and how they handle &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; happening
within the system, let's call those things &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say there are two types of &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt;, those which make the system &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, for example,
in an e-commerce website it could be a user bought something, and those which make the system &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;
its status, for example, update some records in the database o send a request to another service. The
first ones, let's call them &lt;em&gt;external events&lt;/em&gt; because they're triggered by an external actor, maybe the
user or an external system consuming our API, these &lt;em&gt;external events&lt;/em&gt; are the ones triggering the second
ones, let's call them &lt;em&gt;internal events&lt;/em&gt; because it's the system updating itself. So, &lt;em&gt;external events&lt;/em&gt; trigger
&lt;em&gt;internal events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are two ways of handling &lt;em&gt;events&lt;/em&gt;, we can either do it via &lt;em&gt;orchestration&lt;/em&gt;, where we have
a service which acts as the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; of the transaction, telling all the other services involved in it
what to do, what to update. Just like a Conductor does in an Orchestra, it tells all the other musicians
(services) when to play they part, how to play it and so on. The other way is more like a &lt;em&gt;choreography&lt;/em&gt;,
where given an &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt; every service knows how to handle it and how to react to it, just like dancers who
know how and where to move or what do do when a certain part of the song is played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good architectures are a mix of both approaches and good architects know when to use either of those
depending on the business needs and the use case they're modeling. Unfortunately there's no recipe
to decide, gaining experience designing systems and making mistakes are the only way to learn, although
reading about others experience, having clear concepts on how distributed systems and networks work and
a good understanding of the problem at hand we're solving are a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rely on data, not services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke about &lt;em&gt;low coupling and high cohesion&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; in a previous article, relying on
a service to be up in order for some other service to be able to do what it's supposed to do is some
form of &lt;em&gt;coupling&lt;/em&gt;, you are letting an independent system fail because another is feeling unwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For services to be independent, every service should have a copy of the data they need to answer at least
basic queries, this doesn't mean you'll directly update the copies, you need to define which service is going
to be your &lt;em&gt;source of truth&lt;/em&gt; for a specific piece of data and perform all the write operations for it to &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;
service and then, somehow, update the copies. You can rely on &lt;em&gt;internal events&lt;/em&gt; to do this, every time an
&lt;em&gt;external event&lt;/em&gt; triggers an update on the &lt;em&gt;source of truth&lt;/em&gt; for a give piece of data, you can fire up
an &lt;em&gt;internal event&lt;/em&gt; to make the services keeping a copy update their local copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this you can still serve a read-only version of the data for some use cases even if the source of
truth is down, if it's, for example, an e-commerce and the source of truth for the catalog is, for example,
the &lt;em&gt;Inventory Service&lt;/em&gt;, you can still serve the catalog even though the users won't be able to purchase
anything, they still can save them to their &lt;em&gt;wishlist&lt;/em&gt; and browse the website, this lets you gracefully
degrade your system if there are problems with some services, you just show an error message or hide the options
or have alternate workflows until the systems supporting the degraded use case are back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if a service is down and misses some updates from the source of truth?, well, depending on how you propagate
the updates, you can do several things. You can use a queuing system like &lt;em&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/em&gt; to propagate
the updates, so, if a service is down, the updates will be waiting on the queue to be consumed once the service
is up, if you're using HTTP calls, you can have your worker retry the failed requests after a &lt;em&gt;back-off&lt;/em&gt; time or
write the payload to a given location so, when the other service comes up, an &lt;em&gt;init&lt;/em&gt; script checks that location,
reads whatever is there and marks those messages as &lt;em&gt;consumed&lt;/em&gt;, there are multiple ways to deal with this problem,
most of them will depend on the technology you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eventual consistency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you deal with distributed systems and distributed information, chances are, some copies will be stalled
for a period of time, this means, information will always be flowing through the &lt;em&gt;pipes&lt;/em&gt; of your system, the only
way you will have total consistency is if you stop writing and wait some time. Even in monolithic systems, what you
show to the user is stale most of the time, let's say, for example, a website listing used articles for sale, when
the search page is served to the user, depending on the traffic, there will be probably 10ths or hundreds of new
articles the user won't see unless they refresh the page or we have a pushing mechanism in place. So, how important is
it really to show the most updated information available to the user?, truth is, is not that critical in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For building reports though, you should always query from your sources of truth, this could be tricky on a distributed
system where your source of truth varies depending on the information you're looking for and it's not a single database
where you can run a SQL query and join everything together. You could rely also on &lt;em&gt;internal events&lt;/em&gt; to build a reporting
database while the relevant events are happening instead of querying everything when a report is requested, this way you'll
always have relevant business data to produce reports on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no silver bullet to solve the problems that come with distributed computing, however, there are strategies
to help you discover the best way to deal with certain problems for your specific use case, try to use choreography
where possible and orchestrate the flows that need to be completely synchronous, always try to find the easiest solution,
keep in mind that sometimes the easiest way to solve a problem is the hardest to implement, but benefits will be seen
in the future, when you need to debug a failure or scale, or even extend your system with more features or plugging more
microservices in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, always prefer choreography and async communication when possible instead of orchestration and sync calls between
services, this doesn't mean you should avoid it at all cost as there are use cases that need that approach. A good architect
knows that the best way to solve a problem is not following strictly one and only one approach, it's combining different
concepts and ways around it and adapting them to the specific problem to achieve an efficient and elegant solution. &lt;/p&gt;

and archiving old stuff and, I must say: what the hell did I have in my head by that time?, for real, there are
things that are over-engineered, very complicated solutions to simple problems, sub-optimal or inefficient code,
a lot of spaghetti code, highly coupled modules (or django apps), all of this to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, maybe, in a couple of months (or years) I'll go through the code I wrote today, or yesterday and say the
same thing &lt;em&gt;oh my god! was I stupid or what?&lt;/em&gt;, but I believe this is part of every craftsmanship job like software
engineering, graphic design, cooking and even music. You come out of school with the knowledge, but only experience
doing what you're trained to do will give you elegant practices and make you a good professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to evolve is to &lt;strong&gt;never stop learning&lt;/strong&gt;, read a lot of technical stuff, also master your &lt;strong&gt;soft skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
I wrote it bold because they're as important as your technical ones, try out new ways of doing things, programming
paradigms, new programming languages, new tools to add to your stack and adopt better practices or ease some
pains in your development, testing or deploy process, perhaps your company's or your employer's processes. Only by
learning and gaining knowledge and then putting it in practice you will gain experience and know what works, what doesn't
work and what work betters under some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.
— Anton Chekhov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking what made me reflect on this, well, some time ago I wrote about &lt;a href="the-evilness-of-none.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evilness of None&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
how it is a bad practice to &lt;code&gt;return None&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;return null&lt;/code&gt; from functions when you're expecting the output to meet
certain requirements (internal link). Since I wrote that, I've been going through old projects checking how common
this pattern was on my code and, unsurprisingly, I found some other bad practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if checking old code and surprising myself with &lt;em&gt;how stupid I was&lt;/em&gt; is something that happens often, it is a good
thing, it means I've learned something I didn't know by the time I wrote that code. So, always move forward but,
from time to time, check backwards not to adopt bad old habits, but to see how much you've learned and also if there's
anything you need to fix on a project you're maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="software engineering"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>My take on microservices</title><link href="https://iffm.me/my-take-on-microservices.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-30T00:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2017-11-30T00:00:00+04:00</updated><author><name>Israel Fermín Montilla</name></author><id>tag:iffm.me,2017-11-30:/my-take-on-microservices.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of stuff going on these days on &lt;em&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, it's hard to catch up on everything

&lt;p&gt;Microservices …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of stuff going on these days on &lt;em&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, it's hard to catch up on everything 
I would like to. I try to go one topic at a time and now, also because we are working with this at the office,
I'm hooked into microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices is a new word for an old concept, a concept I thought I will never see or play with in real life 
back in my University years, I remember my &lt;em&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Distributed Systems&lt;/em&gt; professors talking
about web services and &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;s and huge systems at IBM,
Sun Microsystems and Oracle, SOAP and REST interfaces and how they interacted with each other and, also, the mighty
Enterprise Service Bus with producers and consumers in Java, BPEL and C#, a very abstract
concept for me to grasp at that time and I thought &lt;strong&gt;the only place&lt;/strong&gt; you could see that was working at &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;, corporate
companies like the ones I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; internet &lt;em&gt;startup&lt;/em&gt; can grow at a &lt;strong&gt;huge scale&lt;/strong&gt; and you can play around with this kind of technologies 
if you're lucky enough to be part of one of those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to be part of the &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt; team, a classifieds website that operates at a &lt;strong&gt;massive scale&lt;/strong&gt; here in the middle east,
the architecture is a huge legacy &lt;strong&gt;monolithic application&lt;/strong&gt; with all of the core functionality and several services surrounding this legacy app.
These services are, in my opinion, mostly &lt;strong&gt;poorly integrated&lt;/strong&gt; and fault tolerance &lt;strong&gt;is not the rule&lt;/strong&gt;, sometimes error responses
are silenced and bypassed which is quite bad. Also, the integration goes over &lt;em&gt;HTTP&lt;/em&gt;, which could be very unreliable
even within the internal network and gives you a lot of headaches when you need to
integrate more and more services. But the whole point of migrating to &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; is to solve all those issues and have a better
engineered platform to keep both product and tech as happy as possible and be able to move faster at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dedicated some time now to study &lt;strong&gt;best practices&lt;/strong&gt; for implementing a microservices based architecture and built some proof of concepts and
deployed one of them to production here are some of my key learning and good practices taken from what I've read and personal experience actually
building stuff at &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt; and playing around with technology on my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;APIs should be business bounded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a common mistake to build &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;s as simple &lt;em&gt;CRUD&lt;/em&gt; interfaces for &lt;em&gt;domain entities&lt;/em&gt;.
This means, all the &lt;em&gt;business logic&lt;/em&gt; must be written and rewritten in the &lt;em&gt;clients&lt;/em&gt;, so, if you have, for instance, a &lt;em&gt;web client&lt;/em&gt;,
a &lt;em&gt;desktop application&lt;/em&gt;, an &lt;em&gt;Android&lt;/em&gt; and an &lt;em&gt;iPhone&lt;/em&gt; mobile apps, well, you can count yourself
how many times you'll have to write the &lt;em&gt;business logic&lt;/em&gt; surrounding those &lt;em&gt;data models&lt;/em&gt; with a &lt;em&gt;CRUD API&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to build your API to encapsulate business processes, not just the objects creation and manipulation, so a single &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt; call,
triggers all the needed processes to fulfill the request or the query the client just gave to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Services must be independent units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, &lt;strong&gt;you must think&lt;/strong&gt; of each &lt;em&gt;microservice&lt;/em&gt; as a project or a &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; on its own, this means each &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; 
has its own &lt;em&gt;box&lt;/em&gt; and its own &lt;em&gt;release pipeline&lt;/em&gt; and its own &lt;em&gt;life cycle&lt;/em&gt;, but also, they don't rely on each other to function.
This means, if your &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; is down, your &lt;em&gt;payment service&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;don't need to suffer&lt;/strong&gt; because of this, you can always accept payments from your users and send the invoices later,
when your &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; comes up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rely on data, not services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous example you might be thinking "dude, but if the &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; is down when the &lt;em&gt;payment service&lt;/em&gt; hits it, how will it know
it needs to send an invoice to a user?". Well, you need some way to let it know once it wakes up, some &lt;em&gt;data sharing&lt;/em&gt; mechanism like a shared
database (which is in general a bad idea because it creates &lt;em&gt;coupling&lt;/em&gt; between our services) or some sort of &lt;em&gt;caching&lt;/em&gt; on the services that needs
to &lt;em&gt;consume&lt;/em&gt; that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, we could make the &lt;em&gt;payment service&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; share the same database, or, have a good separation of
concerns and lower the &lt;em&gt;coupling&lt;/em&gt; and, since &lt;em&gt;invoicing&lt;/em&gt; needs to know about &lt;em&gt;payments&lt;/em&gt; but, &lt;em&gt;payments&lt;/em&gt; have no need to know about &lt;em&gt;invoicing&lt;/em&gt;,
we can just have a &lt;em&gt;caching&lt;/em&gt; mechanism in place in our &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; and have a copy of the needed data about &lt;em&gt;payments&lt;/em&gt; in order
to generate &lt;em&gt;invoices&lt;/em&gt;, of course, this will add some complexity to our system because we need to be fault tolerant and make sure the data
still reaches the &lt;em&gt;cache&lt;/em&gt; if the &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; is down and we need to put some cache update processes in order to keep it up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High cohesion, low coupling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a principle borrowed from &lt;em&gt;Object Oriented Programming&lt;/em&gt;, let's remember what they mean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coupling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;coupling&lt;/strong&gt; is the degree of interdependence between software modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, if two &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; rely too much on each other, chances are if I make a change on one, I'll have to make
a change on the other one to compensate, this makes our code and architecture less orthogonal, which means exactly that, a change in one
part of the system, will affect other unrelated parts, just like driving a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cohesion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cohesion&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, it's a measure of how much the &lt;em&gt;elements&lt;/em&gt; inside a &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt; belong together, not necessarily they rely on each other, but they
all &lt;strong&gt;work together&lt;/strong&gt; towards a common objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general &lt;em&gt;cohesion&lt;/em&gt; is increased if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the &lt;em&gt;elements&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt; have much in common. This means, access the same set of data, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;elements&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt; carry out a &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; number of &lt;strong&gt;related&lt;/strong&gt; activities. This means, each member of the
module does one and only one thing related to the task without side effects  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping &lt;strong&gt;related functionality&lt;/strong&gt; together, we are automatically increasing &lt;em&gt;cohesion&lt;/em&gt; and lowering &lt;em&gt;coupling&lt;/em&gt;, and this is exactly
what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does this mean in microservices?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's easy to think of &lt;em&gt;coupling&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cohesion&lt;/em&gt; withing the same computer program or the same code base, but in &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt; this
means exactly the same, &lt;strong&gt;keep related functionality together&lt;/strong&gt; so you don't have that logic spread all over the place and duplicated
in more than one service. This also mean, keep services using similar or related data together, either logically or physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One hit, one transaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, avoid distributed transaction at all costs, they are difficult to implement and even more difficult to debug if something
goes wrong, ideally one &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; operation to your system should directly affect &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; service, what happens &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; could be a different
story. For example, we could have our &lt;em&gt;payments service&lt;/em&gt; which deals with a third party payment gateway to charge our users' credit cards,
to keep things under &lt;em&gt;Single Responsibility Pattern&lt;/em&gt; (SRP), we will have a separate &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; which handles generating and
sending invoices to the users (I know, we could separate things even more by having a separate &lt;em&gt;notification service&lt;/em&gt; that handles
sending the emails but let's keep it at this level for the sake of simplicity). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the only thing my client needs to know is &lt;em&gt;I need to make a payment&lt;/em&gt;, whatever happens afterwards it's not my client's problem, it
only needs to hit the &lt;em&gt;payments service&lt;/em&gt; with the needed &lt;em&gt;payload&lt;/em&gt; and get the response to show it to the user. What happens under the hood
is my &lt;em&gt;payments service&lt;/em&gt;'s problem, it needs to &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; notify the &lt;em&gt;invoicing service&lt;/em&gt; that it needs to email an invoice to a specific
user, this has to happen &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt;, either we start a separate &lt;em&gt;thread&lt;/em&gt; or use a message queue for it and we notify either generating an
&lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt; or via an &lt;em&gt;HTTP&lt;/em&gt; call, but this needs to happen offline and be fault tolerant so we don't keep the &lt;em&gt;client&lt;/em&gt; waiting for something
that is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; internal process, as well as updating the inventory, generating accounting ledger entries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choreography over orchestration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, to me, one of the most important best practices I've learned then it comes to microservices oriented architecture, when we think of
distributed transactions we often have some sort of &lt;em&gt;director&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;conductor&lt;/em&gt;, which is the service that initiated the transaction, it will
know, what needs to happen and in which order, also, it will be the responsible to roll everything back if any part of the transaction fails,
transactions need to be &lt;em&gt;Atomic&lt;/em&gt;, right?. This is a very dangerous approach because, if something goes wrong while performing the transaction,
nothing can guarantee something won't happen while rolling it back, leaving the system in an inconsistent state and giving us lots of
headaches down the road when having to debug some weird behavior in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to implement these kind of &lt;em&gt;distributed&lt;/em&gt; transactions, i.e., business processes that need to update more than one service
is through &lt;em&gt;Choreography&lt;/em&gt;, if you think about a &lt;em&gt;choreography&lt;/em&gt;, there's no &lt;em&gt;conductor&lt;/em&gt;, everyone knows what they need to do, where they
need to go, the only signal is the music. This means, in &lt;em&gt;microservices&lt;/em&gt;, we just need to &lt;em&gt;notify&lt;/em&gt; everyone &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; happened, and
the concerning &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; will react accordingly, either updating their database, emitting another &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt; or sending a notification to
the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to properly implement &lt;em&gt;choreography&lt;/em&gt; we need to build &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt; services by putting in place fault tolerance logic or processes
so, if some service fails to react, it can heal itself or someone gets notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't rely on HTTP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch"&gt;Peter Deutsch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling"&gt;James Gosling&lt;/a&gt; wrote about the
&lt;em&gt;8 fallacies of distributed computing&lt;/em&gt; and the first one was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is reliable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A million things can happen when you rely on the network, maybe the requests times out, maybe there's a broken link, maybe subnet permissions
were changed maybe the host we are trying to reach is unavailable, maybe a rat ate a network cable, lots of things can happen and we are
not in control of all of them, even withing our own private network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'd recommend instead is to have a &lt;em&gt;communication layer&lt;/em&gt; in the form of a &lt;em&gt;message bus&lt;/em&gt;, it can be a &lt;em&gt;queue&lt;/em&gt; like 
&lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;data streaming pipeline&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt;
of course there will be a bit of network communication between your services and the communication
layer, or your services and the database system, but that's being taken care of by the corresponding drivers or libraries or deal with those,
so, you can assume they're fault tolerant and the data will reach its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be cases where you can't avoid rely on &lt;em&gt;HTTP&lt;/em&gt; or any network protocol, for example, you need to serve your website somehow, and
you need to query your services somehow too, so, in this case I'd recommend to go for a &lt;em&gt;REST API&lt;/em&gt; or whatever protocol you prefer for external
communication (third party services and &lt;em&gt;client-server&lt;/em&gt;) and using a &lt;em&gt;message bus&lt;/em&gt; for inter-service communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A note about the fallacies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will say that the &lt;em&gt;8 fallacies of distributed computing&lt;/em&gt; are obsolete nowadays because there are tools already that handle
everything for us, replication, secure networking, authentication, networks are sophisticated so, latency is not a problem anymore but,
just because &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is taking care of &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; for us, doesn't mean that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; isn't there, imagine building a system without
these tools, you'll have to face them anyways, besides, there are countries where the computer networks are not as good as in the US or
Europe for example, so, I wouldn't say these &lt;em&gt;fallacies&lt;/em&gt; are becoming irrelevant. Even if you're not implementing replication or security
yourself, you need to think about it and use &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that handles that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
